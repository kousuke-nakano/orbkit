# orbkit

**orbkit** is a **JAX-compatible** toolkit for continuous ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, developed entirely from scratch using `Python` and `JAX`. This respository is no longer maintained. All functions that were provided by **orbkit** have been transfered to **jQMC**. Please go to [jQMC website](https://kousuke-nakano.github.io/jQMC/).
